    UUP-SOAP - PHP classes as SOAP services.
=============================================================================

Export your PHP classes as SOAP services with automatic service documentation gathered 
from annotations on class, methods and parameters and availible for service consumer thru 
wsdl:documentation tags.

Features:

    o) Uses the native SOAP extension (fast).
    o) Web service description (WSDL).
    o) Web service API documentation (HTML).

** INTRODUCTION:

    The exported service is either the class name or an object. The latter is is prefered in
    case some special initialization has to be done. The parameter processing (i.e. detect if
    WSDL mode) can be simplified by using the SOAP request class:

        public function response($request, $service)
        {
            $request->process($service);            // Request mode detected
        }

    Or more more detailed where the $request is either some custom class or the one supplied
    by this library:

        public function response($request, $service)
        {
            switch ($request->target) {
                case 'soap':
                    $service->handleRequest();      // Handle SOAP request
                    break;
                case 'wsdl':
                    $service->sendDescription();    // Send WSDL
                    break;
                case 'docs':
                    $service->sendDocumentation();  // Send API doc
                    break;
            }
        }

** TESTING:

    Example Java files can be found in the example/java/client directory. Generate SOAP proxy
    using wsimport or download the full project from:

** ABOUT DERIVED WORK:

    The WSDL generation uses the WSDL_Gen class (its author is unknown), but was republished
    by Martin Goldhahn (mgoldhahn@gmail.com) on Google Code. The license for php-wsdl-generator 
    that bundles that class is Apache 2.0 (same as this package license). A number of improvements
    has been done on that class (see file header).

    The other code was taken from the OpenExam project (openexam.io), relicensed from GPL2
    as Apache 2.0
